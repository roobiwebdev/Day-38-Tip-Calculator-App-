Day 38 of #100DaysChallenge
Good morning, everyone ☀️ Today’s project is another exciting one.

Project Name: Tip Calculator App

This app allows users to quickly calculate the tip amount and the total bill per person by entering the bill amount, choosing a tip percentage, and specifying the number of people. It's clean, simple, and effective, with dynamic updates as inputs change.

Technologies Used
#HTML

#CSS

#JavaScript

HTML Structure
The HTML file sets up the layout with sections for entering the bill amount, selecting the tip percentage, and specifying the number of people. It also includes a display section for showing the calculated tip and total amount per person.

CSS Styling
Font Import: I've used Google Fonts to import the "Space Mono" font for a modern and clean look.

Global Styles: Resets default padding and margin, sets box-sizing, and specifies the font-family for consistency.

Layout: Utilizes Flexbox to center the container and align items. The design includes a clean background, dimensions, padding, border-radius, and a responsive layout.

Interactive Styles: Adds hover effects and active states for a more engaging user experience.

JavaScript Functionality
Input Validation: Validates user inputs for the bill amount, tip percentage, and number of people.

Dynamic Calculations: Calculates and displays the tip amount and total bill per person in real-time as inputs change.

Reset Functionality: Resets all inputs and calculations when the reset button is clicked.
